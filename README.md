Im using Remote Desktop technology which can be used with various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It provides a secure and efficient way to access computers remotely, enabling users to work, troubleshoot, or collaborate from different locations.

i set up the different department's in os ticket. One was named system administrator and the other was support. Jane miltion was working in the system adminustratir position and edward hill was working in the support positon. 
To set up osTicket follow these steps:

1. Verify Server Requirements: Ensure that your server meets the requirements for osTicket, such as a compatible web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx), PHP, and a supported database (MySQL or PostgreSQL).

2. Download osTicket: Visit the official osTicket website (osticket.com) and download the latest stable release of the software.

3. Upload Files: Extract the downloaded osTicket files and upload them to your web server's document root directory or a designated subdirectory.

4. Create Database: Create a new database for osTicket to store its data. You can use tools like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command line to create the database.

5. Run the Installation Wizard: Open your web browser and visit the URL where you uploaded osTicket files. The installation wizard should automatically launch. If not, check if the "install" directory is present.
